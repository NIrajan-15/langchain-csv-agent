# LangChain CSV Query Engine

## Overview
LangChain CSV Query Engine is an AI-powered tool designed to interact with CSV files using natural language. It can:

- **Translate Natural Language**: Convert plain English questions into precise SQL queries.
- **Query CSV Data**: Use the DuckDB engine to execute these SQL queries directly on a local CSV file.
- **Synthesize Answers**: Provide final answers in plain English, not just raw data tables.

## Features

### Natural Language Interface:
- Ask complex questions about your data, including filtering, aggregation, and grouping.
- Understands the context of your CSV's columns to generate accurate queries.

### Data Engine:
- Uses DuckDB for high-performance, in-memory SQL execution.
- No need for a separate database server; all processing is done locally.

### Intelligent & Safe:
- The self-contained chain automatically handles the entire workflow from question to answer.
- Gracefully handles errors from invalid SQL queries and provides helpful feedback.
